# Geometries

The geodataframe (GDF) is a dataframe (DF) where every row represents an geometry  (point, line, polygon). Python requires you to install the **SF** library to work with these structures.

In the repository for this class you will see a folder named **maps**, with files  I have previously downloaded from this [website](https://www.efrainmaps.es/english-version/free-downloads/world/). There are three maps: *countries*, *cities*, and *rivers* of the world.

Visit the [repository](https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_spatial/tree/main) and you may see something like this:

<img src="https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_spatial/blob/main/pics/repo_Git.jpg?raw=true">

When you go inside the _maps_ folder you will see this:

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_spatial/blob/main/pics/repo_Git_mapFolder.jpg?raw=true">

You see:

1.  A folder with files.
2.  Some *.json* files.
3.  Some *.zip* files. These files are zipped or compressed version of the files in the folder (not the folder with files).

Now, take a look a **World_Countries** folder:

<img src="https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_spatial/blob/main/pics/repo_Git_mapFolder_shapes.jpg?raw=true">

There, you see that this **one map** requires **several files**. That is the nature of the shapefile.

When the maps are in GitHub, R can only read **JSON** files. The others will need to be downloaded to the local computer. Then,

```{r}
linkGit_json="https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_spatial/raw/main/maps/World_Countries.json"
```


Let's read the file with the help of **sf**:



```{r}
library(sf)
countriesJson=sf::st_read(linkGit_json)
```



Let's see what we have:


```{r}
typeof(countriesJson)
```

Some more info:


```{r}
str(countriesJson)
```

Notice the presence of the column _"geometry"_.

Let me work with all the maps we have:


```{r}
citiesLinkGit="https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_spatial/raw/main/maps/World_Cities.json"
riversLinkGit="https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_spatial/raw/main/maps/World_Hydrography.json"

citiesJson=sf::st_read(citiesLinkGit)
riversJson=sf::st_read(riversLinkGit)
```

We have three different maps:


```{r}
head(citiesJson)
```

```{r}
head(riversJson)
```


Now you see each file stores different geometries:


```{r}
summary(riversJson$geometry)
```





```{r}
summary(citiesJson$geometry)
```


```{r}
summary(countriesJson$geometry)
```


Let's see the maps:


```{r}
plot(countriesJson['geometry'])
```


```{r}
plot(riversJson['geometry'])
```

```{r}
plot(citiesJson['geometry'])
```




## Map Projection

The projection (CRS) is a very important property of the maps. They affect several aspects:

* shape
* area
* scale
* direction

If you plan on doing some computations with several maps, you should verify that all have the same projection (**CRS**):


```{r}
st_crs(countriesJson)$epsg==st_crs(citiesJson)$epsg
st_crs(countriesJson)$epsg==st_crs(riversJson)$epsg
```
Are they projected:
```{r}
```


```{r}
st_is_longlat(countriesJson)
st_is_longlat(citiesJson)
st_is_longlat(riversJson)
```


They are NOT projected:

```{r}
st_crs(countriesJson)
st_crs(citiesJson)
st_crs(riversJson)
```




Our three maps are not projected. Then some math may not work. Let's work next with one country.

## Subsetting

We want to keep the geometries of one contry. We can subset our maps by *filtering*:


```{r}
# filtering 
brazil=countriesJson[countriesJson$COUNTRY=='Brazil',]
```

But you can also subset by *clipping*, as sometimes other data frames may not have the same fields for filtering:


```{r}
# clipping
citiesBrazil = st_intersection(brazil,citiesJson)
riversBrazil = st_intersection(brazil,riversJson)
```

Can we compute the centroid of Brazil?


```{r}
# this works with warning
st_centroid(brazil)
```

We should avoid the warning  and set the right projection.

## Reprojecting

A projected CRS will have units in meters or feet (or similar). For a more accurate option it is better to look for the ones explicitly prepared for a particular locations of the world. You can request a crs per country [here](https://epsg.io/?q=brazil+kind%3APROJCRS):


```{r}
# recommended for Brazil (meters)
brazil_5641 = st_transform(brazil, "epsg:5641")
st_crs(brazil_5641)
```



```{r}
# this works with no warning

st_centroid(brazil_5641)
```
Let's reproject the others:
```{r}
citiesBrazil_5641=st_transform(citiesBrazil, "epsg:5641")
riversBrazil_5641=st_transform(riversBrazil, "epsg:5641")
```



Finally, we can plot what we have:


```{r}

library(ggplot2)

base=ggplot() 
layer1=base + geom_sf(data=brazil_5641, fill='white')
layer2=layer1 + geom_sf(data=st_centroid(brazil_5641),color='red',size=10)
layer3=layer2 + geom_sf(data=citiesBrazil_5641,color='green',size=5,shape='+')
layer4=layer3 + geom_sf(data=riversBrazil_5641,color='blue',linewidth=0.5)
finalMap=layer4+  coord_sf(datum = st_crs(brazil_5641))
finalMap

```
